## What is Rena Application?

Rena Application is a Discord Bot designed for convenience. It was created with the goal of adding features that make it different from other traditional bots.

## What can this bot even do?

There are useful functions that can be used on a daily basis<br>
Some notable features from Rena Application:

- **avatar,banner command**: It looks useless at first glance, but it is surprisingly useful.
- **Verification command**: Button authentication, web authentication (beta), and image authentication can be used to protect the server from trolling users.
- **ban,kick,timeout,softban,warn command**: There is no need to specify the position of arguments, which is troublesome, and they can be specified by parameters such as "?r". We are developing more user-friendly commands.
